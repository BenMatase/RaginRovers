- sometimes won't load map *probably a networking issue
- ressetting that I made crashes the game most of the time (once you press L and reload the map)
		-breaks in HandleReset method in Game1 from deleting objects and then trying to call the deleted objects
- need nice font for score
- need a better placement for score
- need better point system
		- scorey score-  cat 300, plane 200, board 100, missing -50
		- football score- cat 6 (touchdown), plane 2 (2 point conversion), board 1 (field goal), missing +-1 (either lose one or give the other person one)
- better place to put logo
		-make it smaller
- make it more Easton v. Pburg themed
- put in more soundeffects and wackiness
- need background music
		-found drum line on youtube and converted it but it is too long or something and breaks visual studios
